	Imperium Jets, the US platform designed to open business aviation to the public, help operators turn white spaces into profits and empower travel sellers and passengers, has announced a new partnership with Flitestar, a UK charter brokerage. The partnership will support expansion of access to private aviation both in the United States and in the European market, as Flitestar will distribute and sell Imperium Jets' content. The two companies will also work in partnership at significant aviation events around the world.

	Part of Imperium Jets' risk-free offering is its backend logistical services and by-the-seat regulatory licence, which allow operators and agents to maximise their profits quickly and efficiently by selling private jet flights by the seat. As Imperium Jets continues to expand, its platform and ability to support operators and agents filling empty legs and selling by the seat options will be a differentiating factor in the market.
	<br /><br />
	
	"This partnership with Flitestar will support our vision of increasing the use of by-the-seat booking for business aviation travellers," said Lidor Revah, CEO and co-founder of Imperium Jets. "We are delighted to announce this new strategic partnership with Flitestar, a worldwide provider of global charter services in large commercial airline-style charters with an amazing focus on passenger handling."
	<br /><br />
	
	As the airline industry has struggled in recent years in the face of challenges such as closed airports, delayed flights and challenging time constraints, Imperium Jets has adapted to the new realities of the market. Through partnerships and company leadership, the Imperium team has brought to the market a number of efficient and optimised opportunities and grown its operator network considerably.
