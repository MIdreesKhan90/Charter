	Flitestar is to distribute and sell Imperium Jet's empty leg and by-the-seat content, supporting the platform in its mission to help operators turn white spaces into profits.
	<br /><br />
	
	US-based platform Imperium Jets is partnering with UK charter brokerage Flitestar to support expansion of access to private aviation both in the US and in the European market. Flitestar will distribute and sell Imperium Jets' content and the two companies will also work together at significant aviation events around the world.
	<br /><br />
	
	Part of Imperium Jets' risk-free offering is its back end logistical services and by-the-seat regulatory licence, which allow operators and agents to maximise their profits quickly and efficiently by selling private jet flights by the seat. As Imperium Jets continues to expand, its platform and its ability to support operators and agents filling empty legs and selling by-the-seat options will be a differentiating factor in the market.
	<br /><br />
	
	"This partnership with Flitestar will support our vision of increasing the use of by-the-seat booking for business aviation travellers," says CEO and co-founder Lidor Revah. "We are delighted to announce this new strategic partnership with Flitestar, a worldwide provider of global charter services in large commercial airline charters with an amazing focus on passenger handling."
	<br /><br />
	
	As the airline industry has struggled in recent years in the face of challenges such as closed airports, delayed flights and challenging time constraints, Imperium Jets says it has adapted to the new realities of the market. Through partnerships and company leadership, the Imperium team has brought to the market a number of efficient and optimised opportunities and grown its operator network considerably.
