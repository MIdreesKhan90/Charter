<b>2. As Clear As The Sky</b>
<br /><br />

It is a more common mistake when booking a private jet directly through an operator. But it’s worth mentioning as not being clear on your requirements when booking a private jet charter can be a game changer for the worse.

<b>3. Charge!</b>
<br /><br />

Private jet charters can be expensive, and one of the most common mistakes people make is not understanding the full cost of the trip. Although for some money is not an issue, nonetheless it's important to ask the charter company about all additional fees or charges that may be added to the base price.
<br /><br />
<br />

<b>4. Size matters</b>
<br /><br />

It's important to accurately estimate the size of the aircraft you need when booking a private jet charter. Overestimating the size of the aircraft can lead to unnecessary expenses, while underestimating the size can lead to discomfort and a lack of space. Be sure to provide the charter company with an accurate estimate of the number of passengers and amount of luggage you'll be traveling with.
<br /><br />

A professional private charter flights agency will make sure everything is understood before finding the best jet for you. That being said, make sure to provide them with the actual details and numbers as it will dictate what kind of aircraft they will book for you. Here, saying everything upfront can change the entire experience and may affect the vacation completely.
