	<b>Imperium Jets, a platform designed to open business aviation to the public, has announced a new partnership with Flying Zebra, a private air charter service.</b>
	<br /><br />
	
	This partnership will substantially expand access for the public to private flights between New York and Miami by providing the public with by-the-seat options on eight-seat PC-12 aircraft for round-trip flights on the highly popular New York to Miami route. The private flight seat options will be fully available, and will not require a membership or any extra hidden fees.
	<br /><br />
	
	Flying Zebra is a fully-equipped private air charter service which offers the highest standard of safety and versatility via their fleet of agile and reliable aircraft, as well as a crew which has more than 30,000 hours of experience in the field. The charter service is a pilot-owned company and flies anywhere in the United States, Canada, the Bahamas and the Caribbean.
	<br /><br />
	
	The partnership's initial offering to customers will include 11 flights on PC-12 aircraft between New York and MIami. Each flight will include up to eight customers who will be provided with personalized travel arrangements, such as catered meals, concierge services, and ground transportation. A portion of the available seats have already been sold for these flights, and the first flight will take place on December 23, 2022.
	<br /><br />
	
	Imperium Jets and Flying Zebra's partnership also represents a considerable opportunity to expand business opportunities for agents who are aiming to provide their customers with premium private air charter services, specifically by the seat flights to in-demand locations such as New York, Miami, and other major cities in the contiguous United States and nearby regions.
	<br /><br />
	
	"Our partnership with Flying Zebra is indicative of a revolution within the aviation industry, which has been fueled by innovative technology and expansion of public access," said Lidor Revah, CEO of Imperium Jets. "The dream we had for our company was to ensure that everyone can fly in a private plane, and this is an important step towards that goal."
