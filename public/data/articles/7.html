	Lidor Revah is the CEO of Imperium Jets. 
	<br /><br />
	
	I had the opportunity to sit down with him to discuss Imperium Jets being a solution for private aviation in the future, focusing on the many positives. 
	<br /><br />
	
	While also exploring the current state of private aviation, how expanding quickly could have negative implications and why Imperium Jets see success.
