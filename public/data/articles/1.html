	Imperium Jets—a technology platform enabling private jet operators to fill empty seats and boost revenue through distribution partner networks—is collaborating with charter provider Flying Zebra to offer by-the-seat options on its Pilatus PC-12 turboprop singles for flights between Miami and New York. The private flight seat options don't require a membership or come with any hidden fees.
	<br /><br />
	
	Initially, customers will have access to 11 round-trip flights on Zebra's New York to Miami route, as well as catered meals, concierge services, and ground transportation. Portions of those available seats have been sold, with the first flight taking place on December 23.
	<br /><br />
	
	"Our partnership with Flying Zebra is indicative of a revolution within the aviation industry, which has been fueled by innovative technology and expansion of public access," said Imperium CEO Lidor Revah. "The dream we had for our company was to ensure that everyone can fly in a private plane, and this is an important step towards that goal."
