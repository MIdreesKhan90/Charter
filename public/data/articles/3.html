	<b>Private charter company Flying Zebra has partnered with aviation technology platform Imperium Jets to offer private by-the-seat flights between New York and Miami.</b>
	<br /><br />
	
	The Imperium Jets platform will allow the public to book a round-trip flight with Flying Zebra on their fleet of eight-seater Pilatus PC-12 aircraft, without the need for membership and with no hidden fees.
	<br /><br />
	
	The partnership aims to give customers more freedom than if they were flying commercial, with the option to turn up to flights just 30 minutes before departure at a private airport, and have a "luxurious flight experience at a fraction of the typical charter flight price", according to Imperium Jets.
	<br /><br />
	
	The initial offering, which clients or agents can book through the platform, includes 11 flights on PC-12 aircraft between the two cities. Each flight including personalized travel arrangements such as catered meals, concierge services and ground transportation.
	<br /><br />
	
	Some of the seats have already been sold, according to the companies, with the first flight set to take place next month.
	<br /><br />
	
	"Our partnership with Flying Zebra is indicative of a revolution within the aviation industry which has been fueled by innovative technology and expansion of public access," said Lidor Revah, CEO, Imperium Jets.
	<br /><br />
	
	The technology company's platform is also used by operators to fill empty seats and boost revenue through distribution partner networks.
