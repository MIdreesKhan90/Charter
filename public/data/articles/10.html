	<b>The flights will be aboard Pilatus PC-12s configured for eight passengers.</b>
	<br /><br />
	
	The price is $1,997 per seat, and a spokesperson says the schedule is guaranteed regardless of sales.
	<br /><br />
	
	"Our partnership with Flying Zebra is indicative of a revolution within the aviation industry, which has been fueled by innovative technology and expansion of public access," Lidor Revah, CEO of Imperium Jets, said in a press release.
	<br /><br />
	
	He continues, "The dream we had for our company was to ensure that everyone can fly in a private plane, and this is an important step towards that goal."
	<br /><br />
	
	The start-up is one of many promising it will revolutionize private aviation.
	<br /><br />
	
	"Imperium is the Airbnb of private jets, turning unutilized flights into profit by allowing by the seat sales," according to a profile in Crunchbase.
	<br /><br />
	
	Revah previously told us, "Our goal is to help operators to sell by the seat via Kayak, TripActions, Expedia."
	<br /><br />
	
	In the past, he said Imperium was starting similar by-the-seat flights in California, although it is unsure if they ever got off the ground.
	<br /><br />
	<br />
	
	<b>Competing with JSX</b>
	<br /><br />
	
	Imperium will be going up against JSX, which in December is increasing its flights on the route to daily service.
	<br /><br />
	
	JSX uses reconfigured Embraer regional jets with 30 seats and extra legroom, also saving time using private terminals.
	<br /><br />
	
	JSX fares on the route range from $649 to $1,279 per seat.
	<br /><br />
	
	After we asked the Imperium PR company spokesperson for a schedule, how Imperium expected to compete with a smaller, slower airplane, charging, in some cases, triple the price, and also about its past service promises, we didn't receive a response.
	<br /><br />
	
	We later found some of the schedules on Imperium's ByTheSeat.com website, although it's not clear they are correct.
	<br /><br />
	
	It shows the southbound leg leaving HPN at 9 am and arriving at noon, inferring a total of three hours, aggressive for the PC-12.
	<br /><br />
	
	The northbound leg is scheduled to depart MIA at 2:30 pm and land at 7:30 pm.
