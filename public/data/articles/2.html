	Imperium Jets — a technology platform enabling private jet operators to fill empty seats and boost revenue through distribution partner networks—is collaborating with charter provider Flying Zebra to offer by-the-seat options on its Pilatus PC-12 turboprops for flights between Miami and New York. The options don't require a membership or come with any hidden fees.
	<br /><br />
	
	Initially, customers will have access to 11 round-trip flights on Zebra's New York-to-Miami route, as well as catered meals, concierge services, and ground transportation. Portions of those available seats have been sold, with the first flight set to take place on December 23.
